# µnotes
µnotes is a simple plain-text-file based note application for desktop.

## How it works
When starting, µnotes asks to open a folder and lists all .txt files within. You can then edit, rename and delete these files or add new ones.

## Features
µnotes is kept deliberately simple and minimalist.

### Plain text file based
No proprietary or obscure file format. This makes sure that your data will outlive this application. If the app is no longer maintained or used, text files can be handled by literally almost every other application.

### Private
µnotes works with local files only. It does not depend on any (cloud) service and works offline first. If you want to sync your notes you are free to use any service you want (a file share, Dropbox, OneDrive, ...). Since it works with plain text files, you could also use GIT as a version control system.

### Minimalist
µnotes contains no bloat. It is simple and has very few features on purpose.
